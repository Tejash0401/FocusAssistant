# 🧠 Focus Assistant — Stay Productive, Stay Focused 💻

## 🚩 Overview
**Focus Assistant** is an intelligent, browser-based productivity tool that helps users maintain focus while studying, coding, or working online.  
It detects when the user becomes inactive or distracted and provides timely reminders to refocus — improving concentration and reducing wasted time.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
In a digital environment filled with distractions, users often open their laptops with good intentions but lose focus after a few minutes.  
Traditional focus tools require installation or subscriptions, making them less accessible.  
Focus Assistant solves this by offering a **simple, single-file web app** that works instantly — no setup required.

## 💡 Solution
Focus Assistant uses browser events (keyboard, mouse, and tab activity) to sense when the user becomes idle or switches away from the study tab.  
When inactivity exceeds a set threshold, it triggers:
- A **notification alert**, and  
- An optional **audio reminder**  

This helps users **quickly regain focus** and continue their task efficiently.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Detects user inactivity or tab switch  
✅ Sends reminder notifications with a subtle sound  
✅ Adjustable idle time threshold  
✅ Runs offline (pure HTML + JavaScript)  
✅ Works on any browser or operating system  

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- **HTML5** — for the web interface  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** — for activity tracking & notifications  
- **Browser Notifications API** — for real-time focus reminders
